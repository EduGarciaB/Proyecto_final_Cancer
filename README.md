# Cancer Final Proyect

This is a project based on the challenge issued in : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge/overview where they challenged the competitors to build a model capable of binary classifying images of skin lession cropes between bening or malign cancer.

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `app.py` - The main Python script that you run for your project.
- `explore.py` - A notebook to explore data, play around, visualize, clean, etc. Ideally the notebook code should be migrated to the app.py when moving to production.
- `utils.py` - This file contains utility code for operations like database connections.
- `requirements.txt` - This file contains the list of necessary python packages.
- `models/` - This directory should contain your SQLAlchemy model classes.
- `data/` - This directory contains the following subdirectories:
  - `interin/` - For intermediate data that has been transformed.
  - `processed/` - For the final data to be used for modeling.
  - `raw/` - For raw data without any processing.
 
## Summary

In this project, we built an image model based on ResNet50, partially retraining it to adapt to our specific use case. We explored several approaches to address the significant data imbalance. 

Our final model is a pipeline where the output of a tabular data-only model is used as input, alongside the corresponding image data, to the image model.
